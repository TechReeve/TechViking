## Introduction

In today's dynamic world of digital design, innovation knows no bounds. TechViking brings together CAD/CAM enthusiasts, creators, and manufacturers in a unique ecosystem where they can design, improve, and build real-world objects. Here's what sets us apart:

- **Decentralized Collaboration**: We enable designers and creators to work together on CAD/CAM files for various parts, systems, and machines, known as "Tings."

- **Bitcoin Compensation**: Contributors are rewarded in Bitcoin for their contributions, whether it's designing new Tings or improving existing ones.

- **Interoperability**: All Tings are designed to fit seamlessly with others, promoting compatibility and reducing redundancy.

- **Unique IDs**: Each Ting has a unique Bitcoin address (ID), ensuring proper compensation distribution to contributors and avoiding duplication of designs.

## How It Works

### Creating and Sharing Tings

1. **Designers**: Use our CAD/CAM system to create new Tings, whether it's a fan blade, a connector, or an entire system. Upload your designs and set a price in Bitcoin for access.

2. **Bitcoin Compensation**: When users purchase your Ting, a portion of the payment goes to you, the creator, while the rest is distributed among contributors who have improved the design or the CAD/CAM system itself.

3. **Interconnectivity**: Tings are designed to be modular and compatible, ensuring that they fit seamlessly with other Tings, reducing redundancy, and promoting collaboration.

### Building Your Own Tings

1. **Users**: If you need a part for your project, you can explore our catalog of Tings, purchase the CAD/CAM files, and then decide how you want to obtain the physical part.

2. **Manufacturers**: As a user, you can also choose to have Tings manufactured by contributors ranked high in our CAD/CAM system. This ensures you receive high-quality, reliable parts for your projects.

3. **Contributor Rankings**: Our platform ranks contributors based on their evaluations by other users, helping you make informed decisions when selecting contributors for manufacturing.

## Expanding Possibilities: Physical Goods Marketplace

In addition to the digital realm of CAD/CAM files, we're excited to introduce our Physical Goods Marketplace. This feature allows contributors not only to share CAD/CAM designs but also to buy and sell physical materials and components needed for creating Tings.

### What You Can Expect:

- **Diverse Materials**: Explore a wide range of physical materials, from steel and screws to electronic components and more, all available in one convenient marketplace.

- **Vendor Profiles**: Our contributors can set up vendor profiles, providing detailed information about the physical goods they offer. You'll find listings with pricing, shipping options, and payment methods.

- **Bitcoin Transactions**: Continue to enjoy the simplicity and security of Bitcoin payments for both CAD/CAM files and physical materials. Pay for your purchases effortlessly using Bitcoin.

- **Shipping and Delivery**: We've streamlined the process, enabling efficient tracking and management of shipping and delivery for your physical materials. Expect your items to arrive promptly and securely.

- **Trust and Transparency**: Building trust is essential. You can leave ratings and reviews for vendors and the quality of the physical materials you purchase. Your feedback helps the community thrive.

- **Optional Escrow Service**: For added peace of mind, we offer an optional escrow service for Bitcoin transactions. Funds are securely held until both parties fulfill their commitments.

- **Tailored Search**: Find exactly what you need with our robust search and filter options. Filter by size, quantity, quality, price, and more to discover the perfect materials for your projects.

### Legal Considerations: Protecting Your Rights

We take legal considerations seriously and have implemented measures to protect the rights of both creators and contributors within our CAD/CAM system. Our commitment to legal compliance ensures a safe and trustworthy environment for all users.

### Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA)

- **Bitcoin Payments**: Contributors have the option to receive Bitcoin payments for their contributions. The terms of Bitcoin payments are outlined in our [CLA](CLA.md). Contributors may specify their preference for anonymity and payment address handling during the contribution process.

- **Anonymity**: We respect contributors' privacy. If contributors choose to remain anonymous, they can use a chosen username connected to their payment Bitcoin address. The CLA provides further details on maintaining contributor anonymity.

- **Legal Compliance**: The CLA outlines legal compliance requirements and ensures that contributors understand the terms and conditions for receiving Bitcoin payments.

- **Dispute Resolution**: Our CLA includes a structured dispute resolution process to facilitate fair and equitable resolutions in payment-related matters.

- **Legal Assistance**: Contributors are encouraged to seek legal advice if they have any concerns or questions about the CLA or payment process.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help us improve the CAD/CAM system, add new features, and enhance the overall platform. Please refer to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.

### License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code and designs as per the terms outlined in the license.
